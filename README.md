# akSkeleton

## Deprecation Warning

I recommend that you use Vue, React or even Angular 2 and therefore I won't update this module anymore.

Raise an issue or create a pull request if you want an update.

## Description

Sandbox project for Angular 1.

It integrates the following modules which should be considered for further documentation:

* [akGulp](https://github.com/akullpp/akGulp)
* [eslint-plugin-ak](https://github.com/akullpp/eslint-plugin-ak)

It can be started in development mode with `gulp` or build with `gulp build`.
